FNAF Power and control System for ComputerCraft

## This script simulates a power management system for FNAF-style Minecraft builds.

### Features:
* Clickable buttons on a monitor to toggle power-consuming devices.
* Power drains over time; if it reaches 0, all outputs turn off.
* Redstone outputs for doors, lights, vents, etc.
* Automatically starts shift at 12pm and resets power and stops consumption at 6 AM.

#### To use the script:
First, you will need computercraft and create mod, You start by placing a computer in the world, then put both startup.lua and powersystem.lua in the following folder: (world save folder)/computercraft/computers/(computer id)

### Setting up in the in-game world
Place an **Advanced** monitor beside the computer in any direction\
Turn on the computer. (It should automatically run the script)
Place redstone links on the sides of the computer **or** you can place a redstone relay in any direction beside the computer and place the redstone links on it instead.

Here are some example setups:

### Editing the script:
To edit the script I recommend using notepad or a code editor although you can edit it through a computer in-game.\
Open powersystem.lua using notepad or a code editor.\
Scroll down until you find the edit here area.\
Code comments should help you edit according to your needs.\
In the future this will probably be switched to a separate configuration file for more a more user friendly experience and the ability to update the script without having to re-apply your edits.
